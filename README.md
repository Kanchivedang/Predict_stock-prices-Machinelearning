# Predict_stock-prices-Machinelearning
I am passionate about machine learning.This project showcases the capability of machine learning models to learn stock prices over a good length of time. This project uses pandas for organizing and cleaning the dataset .I have used numpy to display the stock price variations and the volumes variation per stock traded in a single day . I have used an existing project from geeksforgeeks but looking forward and learning to improvise on the model and the data and the features used.Tensorflow the main machine learning library for creating cnn's .
